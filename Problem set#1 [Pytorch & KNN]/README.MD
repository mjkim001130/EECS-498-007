# Assignment 1: Image Classification using PyTorch and k-Nearest Neighbor

This assignment focuses on implementing basic PyTorch operations and building a simple image classification pipeline using a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier. The goals include:

- Working with PyTorch tensors
- Implementing a kNN classifier
- Understanding train/validation/test splits

## Development Environment

I completed this assignment in a local Conda environment with the following configuration:
```
python=3.12.5 
torch 2.4.1+cu121
```
